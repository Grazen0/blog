Uhh... yup. It's been a while. Let's just act as if I didn't not make a single post in the last 6 months, alright?

Cool. (^ ⚆ \_ ⚆ )

Oh, that's right: extensions.

## Variety is awesome!

Visual Studio Code's extension marketplace is **huge**, and by that I mean absolutely **ENORMOUS**. Whether you wanna to build a web app, code a Python script, or completely obliterate your sanity with C++, VSCode most likely has just the extensions you need.

We're here to talk about [_web dev_](/posts/web-dev), though, aren't we? As you might expect, there's a huge plethora of handy extensions for all your web-dev-related shenanigans.

Here goes a list of my own pick!

### [HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)

![Ease your CSS pain](/img/css.png)

The name speaks for itself. This extension provides intellisense and auto-completion for CSS files. Absolutely necessary (mandatory, if you may) for working with anything CSS-related.

Just gonna say that I can't live without it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

### [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

![Looks pretty...](/img/prettier.png)

Make your code _prettier_ with Prettier! (I'm not sorry)

Okay, but speaking for real, this extension is just about as convenient as it gets. As its description says, it's an opinionated code formatter. **Emphasis on "opinionated".** This means that you aren't in complete control over its configuration, so the formatter does a handful of assumptions about your code style.

Why is this a good thing, though? Well, turns out that, if you're like me and don't really care about what foramtting style you use as long as it's consistent, Prettier is an actual blessing from the heavens.

Just adjust a couple of the few formatting options to fit your specific needs, and let the extension do the dirty work for you! I can't stress enough just how useful Prettier is for the average web developer.

### [Auto Rename Tag (?)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

![Is it already built-in, though?](/img/auto-rename-tag.jpg)

Not completely sure what's going on with this one. See, this extension allows your editor to change the name of an HTML tag on both ends simultaneously.

The thing is, VSCode apparently has added built-in support for this already. For some reason, though, this built-in feature doesn't really work for me, so I'm sticking to the extension.

Overall, an incredibly useful feature, which may or may not actually require installing an extension. Maybe I ought to check some things on my end. 🤔

### [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

![Going live in 3, 2, 1...](/img/live-server.jpg)

This extension makes developing and previewing HTML files an absolute _breeze_. Just click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom right corner of the screen, and voilà! You got a server open on your machine to see the page from your browser.

Hold on, it doesn't end there!

One of Live Server's killer features comes from the "live" in its name. Pages hosted by the extension will automatically reload in your browser as you make changes in the editor!

Just how awesome is that?

### [Thunder Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client)

![Bye bye, Postman!](/img/thunder-client.png)

This extension adds an HTTP client directly into VSCode, letting you send and test HTTP requests directly from the comfort of your editor!

It has many features you might expect from a regular HTTP client, like multiple types of payload content, the ability to save request settings, and even support for environment variables. Nice! 😎

## Wrapping things up

So, that's a pick of my favorite extensions for web development in Visual Studio Code. However, I've tried to avoid, for example, framework-specific ones. I'm trying to make this as neutral as possible over here!

If you think I missed something, or wanna discuss **your** own favorite extensions, feel free to leave a comment below! It's always appreciated. ;D
